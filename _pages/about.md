I am Bolin Zhang from Zhejiang University and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, majoring Electrical Engineering, expected to receive the degree of Bachelor of Science in March, 2024. 

My research interests mainly lies in privacy and security of distributed systems. Currently I am working on improving byzantine-tolerant asynchronous consensus protocols closely with Professor [Ren Ling](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/renling) and [Xiaohai Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FU4tiesAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
